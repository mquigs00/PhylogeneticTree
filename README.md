# PhylogeneticTree
Homework Assignment from Data structures and Algorithms Class in Spring of 2022
This folder was provided by my teacher, Chris Tralie, for each student to enter their code in the phylogenetic.py file.
A small portion of the functions and code in phylogenetic.py was provided to get us started, and once the completed code was run it drew the phylogenetic_tree.png image.
